# My x86 assembler

Naturally, I wrote this assembler in assembler. Its source code is organized into two areas.

First, there's processor-agnostic symbol support, address resolution, tokenization, arithmetic, listing and binary generation, assembler API.

Second, there's support for x86-specific opcodes, to make it actually useful.
